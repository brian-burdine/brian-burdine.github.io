## Awesome Inc W23 Bootcamp Week 1

1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
   - So far I would say this week has mostly been as I expected. I knew there would be a lot of information to tackle in week one, and I also expected that we would be easing into it. We were previously introduced to the idea that there is a lot of good instruction material for the basics of any coding task, and there have certainly been a lot of well-produced tutorials and exercises so far. This is my first time working remotely with others using Slack, but I have used things like it just for communicating with people online, so there hasn't been too much of a learning curve there.
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
   - I'm eager to learn some Javascript to go along with the HTML and CSS we're studying now, to be able to add some interactivity to our projects. It feels good to have pieces that interact with each other; CSS is pretty new to me, so I'm happy to learn more about how sheets should be structured to work with a set of pages.
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
   - I like doing puzzles, like sudoku or nonograms. Maybe not surprising for someone getting into programming, but not something I think I've shared before!
