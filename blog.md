### Week 1 - Onboarding Sprint 1

1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
   - So far I would say this week has mostly been as I expected. I knew there would be a lot of information to tackle in week one, and I also expected that we would be easing into it. We were previously introduced to the idea that there is a lot of good instruction material for the basics of any coding task, and there have certainly been a lot of well-produced tutorials and exercises so far. This is my first time working remotely with others using Slack, but I have used things like it just for communicating with people online, so there hasn't been too much of a learning curve there.
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
   - I'm eager to learn some Javascript to go along with the HTML and CSS we're studying now, to be able to add some interactivity to our projects. It feels good to have pieces that interact with each other; CSS is pretty new to me, so I'm happy to learn more about how sheets should be structured to work with a set of pages.
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
   - I like doing puzzles, like sudoku or nonograms. Maybe not surprising for someone getting into programming, but not something I think I've shared before!

### Week 2 - Onboarding Sprint 2 
1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
   - To me, HTML elements feel like like an anchor point for the CSS and Javascript blocks to work on. The HTML document describes in a basic way what a given page is about, and provides a skeleton of a document, while the JavaScript functions like muscles that make the page live and move, and the CSS wraps around it like a skin to determine what people on the outside sees. Not a perfect analogy, but a useful one, I think.
2. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
   - Right now, I would say pseudocoding is something I need to work on. I can describe the general flow of a program fairly easily, but my lack of experience makes it difficult to pin down the exact methodology of the larger steps of a program. I've found it easier to try to write some code and then figure out why it isn't working in the way that I expect it to. After being told that you can spend months on larger projects planning before writing any code, however, I can't imagine that 'try something, then fix it' is something that can work for professional code all that well. I have to get better at completely spelling out a process.
3. What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
   - I've found having questions posted in the Help channel in Slack to be helpful references, despite not having posted many, if any, questions myself so far. I feel like there are frequently common problems we run into at different points of our workflow. Generally I find the material in Slack to be more focused than the broad documentation online. Seeing code demoed, either by the instructor or by fellow students, also helped solidify some things for me.
4. What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
   - I think the biggest impediment I've had so far is integrating new concepts into my work after we've been introduced to an array of things. I've found a couple of times that I've tried to do something by cobbling together pieces of information that I'm currently familiar with, struggled to make it work, then saw that there was some method already defined in JavaScript that greatly simplified the task. 
5. How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
   - A lot of testing and Googling, mostly. I've either written code up to the point where I have something on the screen to modify and iterate on, or I've used the console and debugger in developer mode to try and figure out what the state of things was during operation. So far I don't think I've ever been at a complete loss as to how to proceed, just puzzled as to why something I attempted didn't succeed. I've also found that sometimes earlier demos we did contained pieces of provided code that I understood more later on, and I've been able to use them as examples for problems I encountered down the road.
