### Week 1 - Onboarding Sprint 1

1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
   - So far I would say this week has mostly been as I expected. I knew there would be a lot of information to tackle in week one, and I also expected that we would be easing into it. We were previously introduced to the idea that there is a lot of good instruction material for the basics of any coding task, and there have certainly been a lot of well-produced tutorials and exercises so far. This is my first time working remotely with others using Slack, but I have used things like it just for communicating with people online, so there hasn't been too much of a learning curve there.
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
   - I'm eager to learn some Javascript to go along with the HTML and CSS we're studying now, to be able to add some interactivity to our projects. It feels good to have pieces that interact with each other; CSS is pretty new to me, so I'm happy to learn more about how sheets should be structured to work with a set of pages.
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
   - I like doing puzzles, like sudoku or nonograms. Maybe not surprising for someone getting into programming, but not something I think I've shared before!

### Week 2 - Onboarding Sprint 2 
1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
   - To me, HTML elements feel like like an anchor point for the CSS and Javascript blocks to work on. The HTML document describes in a basic way what a given page is about, and provides a skeleton of a document, while the JavaScript functions like muscles that make the page live and move, and the CSS wraps around it like a skin to determine what people on the outside sees. Not a perfect analogy, but a useful one, I think.
2. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
   - Right now, I would say pseudocoding is something I need to work on. I can describe the general flow of a program fairly easily, but my lack of experience makes it difficult to pin down the exact methodology of the larger steps of a program. I've found it easier to try to write some code and then figure out why it isn't working in the way that I expect it to. After being told that you can spend months on larger projects planning before writing any code, however, I can't imagine that 'try something, then fix it' is something that can work for professional code all that well. I have to get better at completely spelling out a process.
3. What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
   - I've found having questions posted in the Help channel in Slack to be helpful references, despite not having posted many, if any, questions myself so far. I feel like there are frequently common problems we run into at different points of our workflow. Generally I find the material in Slack to be more focused than the broad documentation online. Seeing code demoed, either by the instructor or by fellow students, also helped solidify some things for me.
4. What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
   - I think the biggest impediment I've had so far is integrating new concepts into my work after we've been introduced to an array of things. I've found a couple of times that I've tried to do something by cobbling together pieces of information that I'm currently familiar with, struggled to make it work, then saw that there was some method already defined in JavaScript that greatly simplified the task. 
5. How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
   - A lot of testing and Googling, mostly. I've either written code up to the point where I have something on the screen to modify and iterate on, or I've used the console and debugger in developer mode to try and figure out what the state of things was during operation. So far I don't think I've ever been at a complete loss as to how to proceed, just puzzled as to why something I attempted didn't succeed. I've also found that sometimes earlier demos we did contained pieces of provided code that I understood more later on, and I've been able to use them as examples for problems I encountered down the road.

### Week 3 - Sprint 1: HTML/CSS/JS/State
1. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
   - I think I would describe it as 'knowing when to step back and refocus'. I spent a lot of time working out the logic of presentation project in advance this week, and for the parts that I had gotten down it made the implementation fairly simple. Part of the program I wasn't sure how to do, but I needed get code on screen, so I forged ahead. When I got to the gaps of my understanding, I wrote the first solution that came to mind then tried to make it work. I never felt *stuck*, exactly, but I spent a lot of time not making a lot of progress. The next day I pivoted to a different solution that I thought would avoid some of the pitfalls I was encountering, and while I didn't have it completely executed by demo time I had something that ultimately worked. Maybe I could've reached that conclusion sooner, or reworked my first solution, if I had asked for help, but I didn't really know how to ask the question and came to the implementation kind of late in the day.
2. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
   - Events and how to handle them are something that seem super useful, and are something that I'm not sure how to structure into my code. So far we've only really been introduced to mouse events like 'hover' or 'click', as well as someone using 'onload' to initialize their state object, I think, but I know there's a lot that can be tracked. I really need to figure out how to properly manage the callback functions we create for them. I'm also looking forward to working with local storage and hooking into browser elements like the 'forward' and 'back' buttons, and I want to see if I can get that working in this week's project before we get into our next project.
3. What is your “Why”?
   - I have two major reasons for signing up for the bootcamp. One flatly is the money; I recognize that developers are in demand across the business landscape, so there's good pay and job security in the field. Right now my family is helping me pay for the bootcamp, so getting a job at the end is important to me both so that I don't waste their generosity, and so that in the future I can help them when my parents retire. The other reason I have is more aspirational: I want to be able to contribute with and be recognized for my mind and what I can do with it. My work experience before this was centered around what I could provide with physical labor, making the promises of e-commerce move. And while that work is important and useful, it personally didn't provide a lot of opportunities to bring my own thoughts and experiences to the process, or collaborate with others to see their aspirations realized. I enjoy being able to make something happen just by writing some text on a screen, and figuring out the process to make bigger, more impactful things possible. The feeling of authoring something was something I was lacking in my life. So for me, the bootcamp is an opportunity to both work on the skills needed to work on major creative challenges, as well as show others that I have those abilities. I want to use this time to make a portfolio that shows how I'm learning and what I'm capable of.
